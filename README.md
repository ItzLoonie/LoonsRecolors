# Loons Recolors
Loons Recolors is an Icon Pack for the Town of Salem 2 Icon Packs mod.<br>
Icons for nearly every role have been replaced, and also changes depending on your faction. (eg Town Traitors will have a different icon).


## See an icon missing? / Want to update an icon?
Add it! I'm opening accepting new icons to add to the pack.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If adding an icon for the original faction (eg Coven Leader in Coven), you must also add the icon to RegularBase in the Common folder.<br>

> [!NOTE]
> Vigilante's icon in this pack uses Town of Salem 2's beta icon, as it fits Vigilante better.

> [!NOTE]
> Pestilence and Famine have unique icons so they are not just horse icons.
